# README

This is training project for training graphql 

Things I may want to cover:

* GraphQL (http://graphql.org/learn/): GraphQL is a query language for APIs and a runtime for fulfilling those queries with your existing data. GraphQL provides a complete and understandable description of the data in your API, gives clients the power to ask for exactly what they need and nothing more, makes it easier to evolve APIs over time, and enables powerful developer tools.

* Apollo Client (https://www.apollographql.com): A fully-featured, production ready caching GraphQL client for every server or UI framework

* Rails 5 API: Server for providing APIs

* Swift 3 Client app: Frontend with TODO app
